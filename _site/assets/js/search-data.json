    "content": "This course provides a comprehensive introduction to the field of software analysis, a critical aspect of software development and maintenance. We will delve into both theoretical foundations and practical applications, learning how to analyze, understand, and improve software systems. This course explores a comprehensive set of techniques for software analysis, including practical formal methods, model checking, static and dynamic analysis, and other key approaches to evaluating and improving software systems. Through hands-on project, you will gain experience understanding and applying these techniques and presenting them using a scientific valid methodology. ",
